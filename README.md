# RPM-Counter

RPM counter is a device which is used to measure the Rotation per minute of any circular moving device. The code is working for 8051 Microcontroller. Using IR Sensor, RPM counter can detect the rotation and according to that it generates a pulses which is given to 8051 Microcontroller. Here all computations has been done using code. After that we have made connections between LCD display and 8051 to display and update counts after every 5 seconds.

Here assembly language is used to write the above code.
